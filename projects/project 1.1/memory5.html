<p>Another expensive tragedy. This time though, it was a sunny, warm day; not a freezing cold depressing one. Going 75 mph on the highway, on my way back from class that day, I didn't hear the 'pop' sound since the radio was blasting. I didn't even notice anything wrong when I got home. Dropped my things off, changed, and then headed back out to go to the gym. As I was driving there, I kept hearing this bouncy-ball sound, and of course, didn't think too much of it; it probably came from construction outside. But why was it keep following me around the whole 5 minutes to the gym? When I eventually parked, the hissing sound struck me as I got out of the car. The tire was almost half-flat.</p>
