<p>Back, left-seat, right behind the driver, was always my usual place, up until I got old enough to sit shot-gun. This was my mom's car, so we always took it to run errands or visit close-by places, but never to travel too far. The furthest we would travel with this car would be to New York. The longer trips were reserved for the CRV. In the backseat, I would be free to stretch my legs across the seat if no one was next to me, but oftentimes, it was occupied by bags of groceries or clothes. My power was limited in the back, I had no control over the music, or just went wherever my mom needed to go that day.</p>
