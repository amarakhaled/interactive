<p>Keep both hands on the wheel, at 10:00 and 2:00, at all times, always check your mirrors every so often. Practice defensive driving. The power was finally in my hands. 8 hours of on-the-road training, and 40 hours of sitting in drivers ed later, I finally had full control of the wheel. My dad would take me on drives in our neighborhood; our roles now switched. Him in the passenger seat, and me in front of the wheel. His panicked instructions to turn the left or right signals on and hit the brakes smoothly just made me more nervous. I hit a car the morning of my driving test, but still managed to pass.</p>
