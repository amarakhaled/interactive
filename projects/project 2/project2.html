          <p class="text"><span>there's someone in my head but it's not me</span>Take a close look at yourself in the mirror. Beneath your <sup>1</sup>__________ <sup>2</sup>______ looks churns a hidden universe of networked machinery. The machinery includes a <sup>3</sup>___________ scaffolding of <sup>4</sup>___________ bones, a netting of <sup>5</sup>________ muscles, a good deal of <sup>6</sup>______________ fluid, and a collaboration of <sup>7</sup>_________ organs chugging away in darkness to keep you alive. A sheet of high-tech self-healing <sup>8</sup>________ material that we call skin seamlessly covers your machinery in a <sup>9</sup>_________ package.</p>

          <p class="text">And then there's your brain. Three pounds of the most <sup>10</sup>________ materal we've discovered in the universe. This is the mission control center that drives the whole operation, gathering dispatches through <sup>11</sup>______ portals in the <sup>12</sup>_________ bunker of the skull.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">Your brain is built of cells called neurons and glia ---- hundreds of billions of them. Each one of these cells is a <sup>13</sup>__________ city. And each one contains the entire human genome and traffics billions of molecules in <sup>14</sup>_______ economies. Each cell sends <sup>15</sup>___________ pulses to other cells, up to hundreds of times per second. If you represented each of these trillions and trillions of pulses in your brain by a single photon on light, the combined output would be <sup>16</sup>__________.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">The cells are connected to one another in a network of such <sup>17</sup>__________ <sup>18</sup>______________ that it bankrupts human language and necessitates <sup>19</sup>_______ of mathematics. A <sup>20</sup>_________ neuron makes about ten thousand connections to neighboring neurons. Given the billions of neurons, this means there are many connections in a single cubic centimeter of brain tissue as there are stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>

          <p class="text">The <sup>21</sup>____________ organ in your skull ---- with its <sup>22</sup>consistency of Jell-o---is an alien kind of <sup>22</sup>____________ material. It is composed of <sup>23</sup>___________, <sup>24</sup>__________________ parts, and it <sup>25</sup>_________ outstrips anything we've dreamt of building. So if you ever feel lazy or dull, take heart: your the <sup>26</sup>______, <sup>27</sup>_________ thing on the planet</p>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">Ours in an <sup>28</sup>_________ story. As far as anyone can tell, we're the only system on the planet so <sup>29</sup>_______ that we've thrown ourselves headlong into the game of deciphering our own programming language. Imagine that your desktop computer began to control its own <sup>30</sup>___________ devices, removed its own cover, and pointed its webcam at its own circuitry. That's us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">And what we've discovereed by peering into the skull ranks among the most <sup>31</sup>__________ <sup>32</sup>___________ developments of our species: the recognition that the <sup>33</sup>__________ facets of our behavior, thoughts, and experience are <sup>34</sup>__________ yoked to a <sup>35</sup>_____, <sup>36</sup>____, <sup>37</sup>______________ network called the nervous system. The machinery is utterly <sup>38</sup>________ to us, and yet, somehow, it is us.</p>

          <p class="text"><span>the tremendous magic</span>In 1949, Arthur Alberts traveled from his home in Yonkers, New York, to villages between the Gold Coast and Timbuktu in West Africa. he brought his wife, a camera, a jeep, and -- because of his love of music -- a jeep-powered tape recorder. Wanting to open the ears of the western world, he recorded some of the most <sup>39</sup>__________ music ever to come out of Africa. But Alberts ran into social troubles while using the tape recorder. One West African native heard his voice played back and accused Alberts of "stealing his tongue." Alberts only <sup>40</sup>_______ averted being <sup>41</sup>_________ by taking out a mirror and convincing the man that his tongue was still intact.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">It's not difficult to see why the natives found the taoe recorder so <sup>42</sup>____________. A vocalization seems <sup>43</sup>__________ and <sup>44</sup>________; it is like opening a bag of feathers which scatter on the breeze and can never be retrieved. Voices are <sup>45</sup>__________ and <sup>46</sup>_________, something you cannot hold in your hand.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">So it comes as a surprise that a voice is <sup>47</sup>_______. If you build a <sup>48</sup>______ machine <sup>49</sup>________ enough to detect <sup>50</sup>_____ <sup>51</sup>____________ of the molecules in the air, you can capture these density changes and reproduce them later. We call these machines microphones, and every one of the <sup>52</sup>________ of radios on the planet is proudly serving up bags of feathers once thought irretrievable. When Alberts played the music back from the tape recorder, one West African tribesman depcited the feat as <sup>53</sup>"____________ magic."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">And so it goes with thoughts. What exactly is a thought? It doesn't seem to weigh anything. It feels <sup>54</sup>_____________ and <sup>55</sup>_________. You wouldn't think that a thought has a <sup>56</sup>______ or <sup>57</sup>_______ or any sort of <sup>58</sup>______ instantation. Thoughts seem to be a kind of <sup>59</sup>__________ magic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">But just like voices, thoughts are <sup>60</sup>__________ by physical stuff. We know this because alterations to the brain chnage the kinds of thoughts we can think. In a state of <sup>61</sup>_______ sleep, there are no thoughts. When the brain transitions into <sup>62</sup>_____ sleep, there are <sup>63</sup>_______, <sup>64</sup>_________ thoughts. During the day we enjoy our <sup>65</sup>________, <sup>66</sup>___________ thoughts, which people <sup>67</sup>____________ modulate by spiking the <sup>68</sup>_______ cocktails of the brain with alcohol, narcotics, cigarettes, coffeee, or physical exercise. The state of the <sup>69</sup>________ material determines the state of our thoughts.</p>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">Your consciousness is like a <sup>70</sup>_____ stowaway on a <sup>71</sup>__________ steamship, taking credit for the journey without acknowledging the <sup>72</sup>_______ engineering underfoot. This book is about that <sup>73</sup>_________ fact: how we know it, what it means, and what it explains about people, markets, secrets, strippers, retirement accounts, criminals, artists, Ulysses, drunkards, stroke victims, gamblers, athletes, blood-hounds. racists, lovers, and every decision you've ever taken to be yours.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">Brains are in the business of gathering information and steering behavior appropriately. It doesn't matter whether consciousness is involved in the decision making. And most of the time, it's not. Whether we're talking about <sup>74</sup>_________ eyes, <sup>75</sup>__________, <sup>76</sup>___________, the love of <sup>77</sup>________ foods, or the great idea you had last week, consciousness is the <sup>78</sup>_______ player in the operations of the brain. Our brains run mostly on autopilot, and the <sup>79</sup>___________ mind has little access to the <sup>80</sup>________ and <sup>81</sup>_____________ factory that runs <sup>82</sup>______ it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">The brain is a <sup>83</sup>_______ system, but that doesn't mean it's <sup>84</sup>____________. Our neural circuits were carved by natural selection to solve problems that our ancestors faced during our species' <sup>85</sup>___________ history. Your brain has been <sup>86</sup>________ by evolutionary pressures just as your spleen and eyes have been. And so has your consciousness. Consciousness developed because it was <sup>87</sup>____________, but advantageous only in limited amounts.</p>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">Your consciois mind is that newspaper. Your brain buzzes with activity around the clock, and, just like the nation, almost everything transpires locally: <sup>88</sup>_______ groups are constantly making decisions and sending out messages to other groups. Out of these <sup>89</sup>________ interactions emerge <sup>90</sup>________ coalitions. By the time you read a <sup>91</sup>________ headline, the important action has alrady transpired, the deals are done. You have surprisingly <sup>92</sup>________ access to what happened <sup>93</sup>_______ the scenes. Entire <sup>94</sup>_________ movements gain ground-up support and become <sup>95</sup>___________ before you ever catch wind of them as a feeling or an intuition or a thought that strikes you. You're the <sup>96</sup>________ one to hear the information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
          <p class="text">However, you're an <sup>97</sup>_____ kind of newspaper reader, reading the headline and taking credit for the idea as though you thought of it first. You <sup>98</sup>_________ say, "I just thought of something!", when in fact your brain performed an <sup>99</sup>_________ amount of work before your moemnt of <sup>100</sup>________ struck. When an idea is served up from behind the scenes, your <sup>101</sup>__________ circuitry has been working on it for hours or days or years, consolidating information and trying out new combinations. But you take credit without further wonderment at the <sup>102</sup>______, <sup>103</sup>__________ machinery behind the scenes.</p>
