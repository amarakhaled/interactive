<p>It was super cold that day, it was one of the first frosts, my car always stayed outside, and I was running late for my Drawing 1 class freshman year. I ran out of my house and was annoyed to find the windshield covered in a thick layer of icy frost. Already out of time, I quickly scraped off a little patch in front of the drivers seat window and hopped into the car, backing out of the driveway without warming it up first. As I was driving, the little patch I had "un-frosted" kept fogging up, and as a genius resort, I pulled down the window to look outside while I drove. A mile or two away from home, I made a right turn and heard a horrible scraping sound. As I got out, I already dreaded what I would see. The bumper of the car was half-off. Well, there goes $1700.00.</p>
