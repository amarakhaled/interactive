<p>Everyday feels so robotic; same routine, same route. The passenegr seat is occupied by all the things I need on hand; my backpack; only because it has my wallet, the necessary mask, and sometimes food if I decide to stop by at a drive-through on my way home. It's like a moving bedside table. I put stuff in the passenger seat if it really needs to come out with me; anything that gets thrown in the backseat are things that are usually forgotten and end up staying there for days; even weeks.</p>
