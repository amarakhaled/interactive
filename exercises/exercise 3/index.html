<p>As someone who is fully immersed in the digital age of graphic design, I rely heavily on the use of computer-generated work as my medium. I never considered asking myself if the computer is something I work ‘on’ or ‘within.’ As most of my college career focused on print media, I always assumed the computer was just</p>
<p id="line-through">a tool to assist in the making of something bigger.</p>
<p>However, reading ‘Jodi’s Infrastructure’ led me to consider ways in which content dissolves into context and context itself becomes content. Evidently, there is no content, since the</p>
<div class="background-gradient">
    medium is the message
    </div>
<p>and all content is overwhelmed by context. In Jodi, the texture of codenand computing takes over, such as the strange logic, grammar, structure, shape, and color, produces aesthetics. One thing that greatly stood out to me was how Jodi’s IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) seems to resemble concrete poetry, but they have woven geometric shapes from a complicated hypertextual structure. Furthermore, they create an animation frame by frame from discontinuous elements, and infrastructure is the make-up of server software, which addresses technologies, transfer protocols/web browsers, and the HTML they are designed to display. Overall, a new web page can be inserted between two existing ones, creating an infinitely larger system.
