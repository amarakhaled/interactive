    <marquee>2004 Honda Civic, 46,000 miles, older than my younger sister.</marquee>
    <marquee direction="right">My first memories come from sitting in the backset of the car. As I grew older, I eventually got promotoed to sitting in the passenger seat.</marquee>
    <marquee direction="left">The smell of fresh pine from the scented ornament hanging from the rearview mirror overwhelms my thoughts, but as I got more used to it, it started going away and all I smelled was nothing.</marquee>
    <marquee direction="right">Sitting on the drivers side and being in control of the wheel was frightening. My dad's yells and directions made my heart beat faster than it already was. My mom kept telling me to think of the car as an extension of my own body.</marquee>
    <marquee direction="left">The control of the car gave me my first sense of freedom.</marquee>
    <marquee direction="right">Eventually, it began to be the place where I spent the most amount of time. The daily one hour commute sometimes led to detours to other places.</marquee>
    <marquee direction="left">Eating, drinking, sleeping, it became my second home.</marquee>
    <marquee direction="right">The feeling of the cold, hard wheel in the winter turned my fingers blue, while in the summer, the sweltering heat from staying in the garage all night burned through my skin as I put my seatbelt on.</marquee>
    <marquee direction="left">It survived through my first 'crash' too, if we even want to call it a crash. But at that time, it felt like the worst thing ever.</marquee>
